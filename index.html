    <p>Hey, you can call me Alistaired, it's actually a corruption of the name Alistair which is , funnily enough, an anglicised form of a Scottish Gaelic variant of the Norman French Alexandre which comes from Greek hahahaa
I couldn't use the correct form Alistair as I created my Night elf death knight so I added "ed" and that's how my WOTLK character was born.
So what is this site for ? I'm an engineer, I like to delve into science with the same approach and aesthetic of a druid or a middle eastern alchemist.
 Mathematics, Computer science and engineering are fun and very magical , who needs a fantasy world or magic when you can communicate with someone thousands of kilometers away instantly, although I have an appreciation of fantasy but let it not be forgotten that fantasy is just an re imagination of our own world through our own eyes.
In this site I will be posting all the projects, documents I have worked on or came across with, hopefully, detailed explanations, I will also be posting random and whimsical pieces of my own writings or literary excerpts that I have found to be interesting, in fact several years ago, I made an attempt at fantasy writing and it was abysmal,
 perhaps it shall be better in the future.
 
 Welcome into my lair and grab a tea!</p>
